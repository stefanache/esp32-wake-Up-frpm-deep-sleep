# esp32-wake-Up-frpm-deep-sleep
<h1>timer vs touch-pad vs ext0/1</h1>
<pre>I worked with :
    HW: esp wroom 32 module from devkitC development-board(expressif manufacturer/provider)
    SW: arduino c IDE(.ino)</pre>
Remark: I used the unvolative memory from RTC to store some values into dynamic variables.
        Need that because on durring sleep the content of static variables will be lost!
